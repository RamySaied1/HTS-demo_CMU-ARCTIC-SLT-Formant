HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT-Formant
===============================

The goal of this demo is to synthesize formants from text using HTS 2.2 text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) toolkit.
It is a modification of the Normal demo provided in the HTS website (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/archives/2.2/HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT.tar.bz2).
The difference is that it uses a tcl/tk script to extract the formant frequencies and bandwidth.
It gives you a good example on how to use another set of features instead of SPTK Mceps which are provided in the HTS Normal demo.
The speaker is CMU-ARCTIC-SLT.
The installation instruction are provided in INSTALL.
